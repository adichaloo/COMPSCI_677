Our code based is organized based on the three scenarios (cache, cache-less and fault tolerant). Code for each
scenario cache less, cache, and fault tolerant is organized into folders named A1, A2, and A3 respectively.
To run each scenario, run network.py in each folder. Parameters associated with each scenario are listed as
global variables in the same file

Each of our experiments can be run from experiment.py inside each folder. experiment.py in
folder A2 reports for E1. For E2 the test can be run from experiment overselling.py file and running
oversell collector.py together.
